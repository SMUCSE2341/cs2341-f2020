## Homework and Quizzes

- Homework will be mostly related to ZyBooks Exercises
- Quizzes maybe administered in lecture or lab. 

## Programming Projects

- Learn by doing!
- If you've never programmed before, don't worry!  We will guide you!
- 10% bonus credit for submitting 48 hours early. 
- Everyone gets one 2-day free extension, no questions asked.  
- You need to plan for at least a few hours of work per week outside of lecture and lab

## Attendance

- You'll need to attend class to be successful.  

- I'll talk about things that aren't necessarily in ZyBooks. 

- If you're attending virtually:
  - Turn your camera on and microphone off
  - Please be mostly vertical (aka. not in bed)
  - Please be dressed as you would if attending class in person. 

## Academic Ethics 

- You must be prepared to defend any code or assignment that you submit.  
- DO NOT ever share your code with anyone. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT!!!
- You are encouraged to talk about the assignments at an abstract level.  However, you cannot share your solutions with another student.  

## General Comments

- Wear a face mask at all times
- Try and keep your phone from dominating your attention.
- Don't surf r/memes or other sites that may be distracting to those sitting around you
- Ostentatious yawning is a huge pet peeve...

## Getting Set up for Python

**Anaconda**

- Anaconda Python is a particular distribution of the language plus bunches of other tools
- Makes it a snap to install on multiple platforms

- Go to [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), scroll to the bottom, and choose the installer for your platform.  
  - More platform-specific instructions: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
- Open Anaconda Navigator to verify it was installed. 

## To Do:

- Register for Slack and the **#20f-1340-general** channel. 
  - Add a profile picture!
- Install Anaconda!
- Read Chapter 1 of ZyBooks before Thursday's class. 
_(I'll send out some more specific directions on the various exercises tomorrow.)_
