# Data Structures - Fall 2020

Welcome to the website for our course this semester.  While there are two sections of lecture, we will operate in some sense as one big Data Structures Family!  

Check out the list of links on the left.  I'll be adding to it over the next few days and, of course, throughout the semester.
